<section><h2>About</h2>

<p>Hydra is a Nix-based continuous build system, released under
the terms of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU
GPLv3 or (at your option) any later version</a>.  It continuously
checks out sources of software projects from version management
systems to build, test and release them.  The build tasks are
described using Nix expressions.  This allows a Hydra build task to
specify all the dependencies needed to build or test a project.  It
supports a number of operating systems, such as various GNU/Linux
flavours, Mac OS X, and Windows.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl">Delft University of
Technology</a> we run a <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/">Hydra-based
build farm</a> to build and test the NixOS GNU/Linux distribution, the Nix
Packages collection, the Stratego/XT program transformation system,
and various other open source projects.  If you want to use our build
farm for your open source project, <a
href="mailto:rob.vermaas@gmail.com">please let us know</a>.</p>

        NixOS is already known as
        <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">the most up to date distribution</a>
        while also being
        <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/total">the distribution with the most packages</a>.
        This release saw <strong>9147 new</strong> packages and <strong>18700 updated</strong> packages in Nixpkgs.
        We also <strong>removed 4015</strong> packages in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure.
        <br />
        In addition to packages the NixOS distribution also features modules and tests that make it what it is.
        This release brought <strong>113 new</strong> modules and <strong>removed 18</strong>.
        In that process we <strong>added 1565</strong> options and <strong>removed 362</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>GNOME 45</h3>

      <p>
        GNOME has been updated to version 45 "Rīga", which introduces a new image viewer, a new camera app,
        and more changes. Refer to the <a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/">release notes</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h3>Default LLVM Version</h3>

      <p>
        The default version for the LLVM package set has been updated to 16 (from 11) on both Linux and Darwin,
        which introduced lots of new features and improvements. The full lists of changes are available
        <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/16.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html">here (LLVM)</a>
        and <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/16.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html">here (Clang)</a>.

        Our thanks go the contributors who also take care of the continued stability and

      </p>

      <p>
        NixOS is already known as
        <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">the most up to date distribution</a>
        while also being
        <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/total">the distribution with the most packages</a>.
        This release saw <strong>16240 new</strong> packages and <strong>13524 updated</strong> packages in Nixpkgs.
        We also <strong>removed 13466</strong> packages in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure.
        <br />
        In addition to packages the NixOS distribution also features modules and tests that make it what it is.
        This release brought <strong>282 new</strong> modules and <strong>removed 183</strong>.
        In that process we <strong>added 2882</strong> options and <strong>removed 728</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Removal of weak hashing algorithms</h3>

      <p>
        The support for weak password hashing algorithms through the <code>crypt(3)</code> API was disabled in NixOS
        23.05. We consider password hashing methods weak if the libxcrypt project did not flag them <a href="https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/blob/v4.4.33/lib/hashes.conf#L41">strong</a>.

        This change affects user accounts on the local system, as well as the supported algorithms in many applications
        that rely on that API. Examples are authentication services like OpenLDAP or PAM, databases like PostgreSQL and, more generally speaking,
        programming languages that offer a password hashing interface like Python. These applications should be migrated away from weak password
        hashes before upgrading to NixOS 23.05, as the lack of support for these algorithms may make authentication for these
        applications impossible.

        If your system has user accounts that rely on such weak hashing algorithms, a warning will be emitted during activation. 
        Existing users accounts are most likely using sha512crypt, for which the hash is prefixed with <i>$6$</i>. These will continue to
        work for the foreseeable future, but migrating to more modern hashes is strongly recommended anyway.
        Interactively configured passwords can be updated using <strong>passwd</strong>, new password hashes can be generated through <strong>mkpasswd</strong>.

        Note, that we do offer <code>libxcrypt-legacy</code> as an escape hatch, that affected packages can be overridden with.
      </p>

      <h3>Bootspec (RFC-125)</h3>

      <p>
        As part of standardization efforts in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0125-bootspec.md">RFC 125</a>, also called "Bootspec", all new users have a <code>boot.json</code> file in their system top-level derivation,
        you can check the one on the system you are running in <i>/run/current-system/boot.json</i> for example.
        <br />
        The idea behind Bootspec is to enable new boot usecases in NixOS: UEFI Secure Boot, unifying bootloader installer scripts,
        multiple initrds or systemd system extensions and A/B schemas.
      </p>


      <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
      <p>
        We want to personally thank <a href="https://github.com/riotbib">Lennart Mühlenmeier</a> and <a href="https://github.com/winterqt">Winter</a> for editorializing the release notes,
        <a href="https://github.com/vcunat">Vladimír Čunát</a> for his tireless effort in managing jobsets, staging cycles and build infrastructure,
        <a href="https://github.com/cole-h">Cole Helbling</a> for his epic effort in bisecting kernel issues with ARM64 for our remote builders,
        and <a href="https://github.com/grahamc">Graham Christensen</a> for dutifully tending to our build infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflections and Closing</h3>
      <p>
        I am very grateful for being given the opportunity to learn about the release process and run it with the help of everyone in the NixOS community.
        It has been a very exciting ride and witnessing the efforts of everyone poured in the project made me want to work towards supporting
        those efforts in many areas of the project, e.g. CI, infrastructure and more.

        Now that the process documentation has reached, in my experience, a high level of maturity. I believe it is now time for tooling to
        become consolidated, professional, comfortable and helpful for release managers and editors but also to all the persons close to the release process.

        As a previous release manager said it, the release process shall become only more boring in the future!

      <h3>Password hashing migration</h3>

      <p>
        During the NixOS 22.11 lifecycle old password hashes may need to be updated, because we plan to disable
        weak password hashes in NixOS 23.05. We consider password hashing methods weak, if
        the libxcrypt project did not flag them <a href="https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/blob/v4.4.30/lib/hashes.conf#L41">strong</a>.
        If your system is configured with weak hashes a script will emit a warning during activation. We expect
        most users accounts to be set up with sha512crypt (hash prefixed with <i>$6$</i>) which we will continue to support.
        Interactively configured passwords can be updated using <strong>passwd</strong>, new password hashes can be generated through <strong>mkpasswd</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>aarch64-linux channel merge</h3>

      <p>
        The separate aarch64-linux specific channels have been discontinued. Their jobs have been merged into the generic
        <strong>nixos-22.11</strong> and <strong>nixos-22.11-small</strong> channels and will thereby receive
        updates at the same time as their x86_64-linux counterparts.
      </p>

      <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
      <p>
        We want to personally thank <a href="https://github.com/winterqt">Winter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mic92">Jörg Thalheim</a> for editorializing the release notes,
        <a href="https://github.com/vcunat">Vladimír Čunát</a> for his tireless effort in managing jobsets and staging cycles,
        and <a href="https://github.com/grahamc">Graham Christensen</a> for dutifully tending to our build infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflections and Closing</h3>
      <p>
        I'm thankful for being given the chance to guide the release process. It is an exciting experience and seeing the tremendous collaborative effort
        the community invests to make the release a success is inspiring.
        While previous release managers made great strides to document the process there are lots of steps that could be benefit from better documentation
        and more tooling. It is our hope that future release managers and the community will iterate further on this.

      <p>
        The 22.05 release was possible due to the efforts of <strong>1611</strong>
        contributors in <strong>46727</strong> commits. We would especially
        like to thank our top 10 contributors:
        <a href="https://github.com/fabaff">Fabian Affolter</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/supersandro2000">Sandro Jäckel</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/mweinelt">Martin Weinelt</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/bobby285271">Bobby Rong</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/marsam">Mario Rodas</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/jonringer">Jonathan Ringer</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/jtojnar">Jan Tojnar</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/mic92">Jörg Thalheim</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/sternenseemann">sternenseemann</a>, and
        <a href="https://github.com/dotlambda">Robert Schütz</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        NixOS is already known as
        <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">the most up to date distribution</a>
        and is
        <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/total">the distribution with the most packages</a>.
        This release saw <strong>9345 new</strong> packages and <strong>10666 updated</strong> packages.
        Removal of unmaintained packages is also important to keep the package set working and secure.
        This release <strong>removed 5874</strong> packages that were available in 21.11.
        <br/>
        nixpkgs also includes a lot of modules that make NixOS what it is. This release brought <strong>89 new</strong> modules and <strong>removed 27</strong>. In that process, the contributors <strong>added 1304</strong> options and <strong>removed 359</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Nix 2.8</h3>

      <p>
        This release brings nix 2.8 as the default nix package. This brings users a lot of fixes, general improvements
        and increased performance. The main feature that was awaited for a long time is the introduction of experimental
        features, namely the <strong>flakes</strong> experimental feature. Users still have to opt into the feature manually
        (as well as the <strong>nix-command</strong> feature that was enabled by default in previous nix versions).
      </p>

      <h3>Graphical installer</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="/images/screenshots/nixos-installer.png">
          <img class="inline" src="/images/screenshots/nixos-installer-small.png" alt="Screenshot of the NixOS graphical installer" width="100" />
        </a>

        Improving experience for new users is something that the NixOS project has been working on for a long time. After all,
        NixOS is a very different compared to traditional distributions. To make it easier to get started with a new NixOS
        system, a graphical installer based on <a href="https://calamares.io">Calamares</a> is now provided. This installer
        starts by default when launching the GNOME or Plasma ISO and allows for one-time configuration of a new system.
      </p>

      <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mic92">Jörg Thalheim</a> who helped with the changelog as the release editor. Also to <a href="https://github.com/jonringer">Jon Ringer</a> for guiding the release process since NixOS 20.09. <a href="https://github.com/vcunat">Vladimír Čunát</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mweinelt">Martin Weinelt</a> for their continued efforts managing and stabilizing staging. More thanks go out to <a href="https://github.com/mweinelt">Martin Weinelt</a> for helping me with a lot of questions about the process and some subsystems, your help was greatly appreciated. Also thanks a lot to <a href="https://github.com/grahamc">Graham Christensen</a> for organizing with <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal</a> to ensure we had enough compute resources and the entire infrastructure team.
        <br/>
        Additional thanks go out to <a href="https://github.com/Mindavi">Rick van Schijndel</a> for going through all the pain of marking packages that do not build anymore as broken. I hope we can make the process more straightforward in future releases.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflections and Closing</h3>
      <p>
        This release brought a lot of features and improvements I've been waiting to see in a release channel. It was a great pleasure working with the community and seeing incredible amounts of work being done by the entire community.

    <title id="nix-2.8.0">
      Nix 2.8.0 released
    </title>
    <description>
      <p>
        We're pleased to announce the availability of Nix 2.8.0. It will be
        available from <a href="https://nixos.org/download.html">NixOS -
        Getting Nix / NixOS</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the release notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          New experimental command: <code>nix fmt</code>, which applies a
          formatter defined by the <code>formatter.&lt;system&gt;</code> flake
          output to the Nix expressions in a flake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Various Nix commands can now read expressions from standard input 
          using <code>--file -</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            New experimental builtin function
            <code>builtins.fetchClosure</code> that copies a closure from a
            binary cache at evaluation time and rewrites it to
            content-addressed form (if it isn’t already). Like
            <code>builtins.storePath</code>, this allows importing pre-built
            store paths; the difference is that it doesn’t require the user to
            configure binary caches and trusted public keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            This function is only available if you enable the experimental
            feature <code>fetch-closure</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            New experimental feature: <i>impure derivations</i>. These are
            derivations that can produce a different result every time they’re
            built. Here is an example:
          </p>
      <pre class="terminal-console">
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "impure";
  __impure = true; # marks this derivation as impure
  buildCommand = "date > $out";
}
</pre>
          <p>
            Running nix build twice on this expression will build the
            derivation twice, producing two different content-addressed store
            paths. Like fixed-output derivations, impure derivations have
            access to the network. Only fixed-output derivations and impure
            derivations can depend on an impure derivation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>nix store make-content-addressable</code> has been renamed to
          nix store <code>make-content-addressed</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <code>nixosModule</code> flake output attribute has been
            renamed consistent with the <code>.default</code> renames in Nix
            2.7.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>nixosModule</code> → <code>nixosModules.default</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As before, the old output will continue to work, but <code>nix
            flake check</code> will issue a warning about it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>nix run</code> is now stricter in what it accepts: members of
          the <code>apps</code> flake output are now required to be apps (as
          defined in
          <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-run.html#apps">the manual</a>),
          and members of <code>packages</code> or <code>legacyPackages</code>
          must be derivations (not apps).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/milestone/17">next release</a>
        is scheduled for <time>2022-05-30</time>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you to all the contributors!

        We're pleased to announce the availability of Nix 2.7.0. It will be 
        available from 
        <a href="https://nixos.org/download.html">NixOS - Getting Nix / NixOS</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the release notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nix will now make some helpful suggestions when you mistype something
          on the command line. For instance, if you type nix build
          <code>nixpkgs#thunderbrd</code>, it will suggest
          <code>thunderbird</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A number of “default” flake output attributes have been renamed.
            These are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>defaultPackage.&lt;system&gt;</code> → <code>packages.&lt;system&gt;.default</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>defaultApps.&lt;system&gt;</code> → <code>apps.&lt;system&gt;.default</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>defaultTemplate</code> → <code>templates.default</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>defaultBundler.&lt;system&gt;</code> → <code>bundlers.&lt;system&gt;.default</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>overlay</code> → <code>overlays.default</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>devShell.&lt;system&gt;</code> → <code>devShells.&lt;system&gt;.default</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The old flake output attributes still work, but
            <code>nix flake check</code> will warn about them.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          Breaking API change: <code>nix bundle</code> now supports bundlers of
          the form <code>bundler.&lt;system&gt;.&lt;name&gt;= derivation:
          another-derivation;</code>. This supports additional functionality
          to inspect evaluation information during bundling. A new repository
          73 has various bundlers implemented.
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>nix store ping</code> now reports the version of the remote Nix
          daemon.
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>nix flake {init,new}</code> now display information about which
          files have been created.
        </li>

        <li>
          Templates can now define a <code>welcomeText</code> attribute, which
          is printed out by <code>nix flake {init,new} --template &lt;template&gt;</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The next release 149 is scheduled for .
        The <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/milestone/16">next release</a>

    <title id="community-survey-2022">
      NixOS Community Survey 2022
    </title>
    <description>
      <p>
        The NixOS Marketing Team is pleased to announce the first offical 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://survey.nixos.org/2022">NixOS Community Survey</a>. 
        Please take 5-10 minutes to complete <a target="_blank" href="https://survey.nixos.org/2022">it</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Nix community has been growing faster and larger every month, it's gotten harder to 
        understand who makes up the community and what everyone cares about. So we're conducting this survey 
        to improve our understanding of those questions. We hope to use your responses to develop Nix, NixOS, 
        and Nixpkgs to match your needs and come up with new ideas for growing and serving the community. And 
        we'll publish major findings on Discourse and nixos.org. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All the questions are optional, and all responses are automatically anonymized. We will NOT collect your 
        name, phone number, GitHub handle, IP address, or any other identifying information.
      </p>
      <p>
      The questions in the survey cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your background (e.g. What region of the world are you from?)
        </li>
        <li>
          The projects you use in the ecosystem (e.g. Are you using NixOS?)
        </li>
        <li>
          How you use the projects (e.g. Do you use Nix in production servers?)
        </li>
        <li>
          What you like and dislike about the projects (e.g. What do you think is already great about Nix? 
          What do you think contributors should focus on improving?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This is our first time running a survey like this, so we're also looking for feedback on the survey itself to 
      understand how we can do this better in the future! Thanks!
      </p>

    <title id="nix-2.6.0">
      Nix 2.6.0 released
    </title>
    <description>
      <p>
        We're pleased to announce the availability of
        <a href="https://releases.nixos.org/?prefix=nix/nix-2.6.0/">Nix 2.6.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructions how to install Nix on different platforms can be found on
        <a href="/download.html#download-nix">the download page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the release notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          New builtin function <code>builtins.zipAttrsWith</code> with the same
          functionality as <code>lib.zipAttrsWith</code> from Nixpkgs, but
          much more efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Nix CLI now searches for a <code>flake.nix</code> up until the
          root of the current Git repository or a filesystem boundary rather
          than just in the current directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          The TOML parser used by <code>builtins.fromTOML</code> has been
          replaced by <a href="https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11">a more 
          compliant one</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added <code>:st</code>/<code>:show-trace</code> commands to nix repl, which are used to set or
          toggle display of error traces.
        </li>
        <li>
          New command <code>nix store copy-log</code> to copy build logs from
          one store to another.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>commit-lockfile-summary</code> option can be set to a
          non-empty string to override the commit summary used when commiting
          an updated lockfile. This may be used in conjunction with the 
          <code>nixConfig</code> attribute in <code>flake.nix</code> to better
          conform to repository conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>docker run -ti nixos/nix:master</code> will place you in the Docker container with the latest version of Nix from the master branch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/milestone/15">next release</a>
        is scheduled for <time>2022-03-07</time>.

      <h3>Stabilization Contributors</h3>

      <p>
        Stabilization of the NixOS happens a month before the planned release. The
        goal is to have as little as possible continuous integration (Hydra)
        jobs failing before the release is cut.

        Individuals who contributed to stabilizing this release:

      <h3>Reflections and Closing</h3>
      <p>
          The influx of additional interest in Nix/NixOS is exciting to see.  The fairly smooth release cycle is due to the dedication and time of all the volunteers in the community. The continued growth and improvements have been incredible to witness.

        <li>14109 packages were removed</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        Likewise, our NixOS module system got bigger and better:

      <ul>
        <li>1527 options were added</li>
        <li>290 options removed</li>

      <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to give a special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jtojnar">Jan Tojnar</a> and others for the Gnome 40 stabilization effort. Another special thanks should be given to <a href="https://github.com/ttuegel">Thomas Tuegel</a> and many others for bringing Plasma 5.21 to NixOS.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflections and Closing</h3>

      <p>
          I think the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/80">RFC80</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/85">RFC85</a>
        changes to the release process were successful in limiting risk and making the release more deterministic.
        This is the first release since 17.03 to have released in the intended month, although the rendered manual and
        official announcement were delayed a day. In the future, I hope to make the release as "boring" as possible,
        and have it be a time to improve the quality of nixpkgs' unstable and stable channels.

      <h3>Reflections and Closing</h3>

      <p>
        I think that the 20.09 release highlighted a few weak points with our current release schedule.
        Discussions have already began on how to improve the process from the beginning, to help minimize
        risk, and set ourselves up for more successes in the future. I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/worldofpeace">WORLDofPEACE</a>
        (my co-release-manager) for helping me with release management items, <a href="https://github.com/ttuegel">Thomas Tuegel</a> for
        helping with Qt and Plasma stabilization, as well as <a href="https://github.com/risicle">Robert Scott</a> for his work with release stabilization.

      <h3>My Reflections and Closing</h3>
      <p>
        Being release manager for 20.03 has been a poignant moment for me in
        being part of NixOS. I had my goals that I set out before I was
        appointed, but I was really surprised how respected I am in the
        community. My primary goal was “work collaboratively with all
        participants in the NixOS project and being supportive of their
        efforts”. I feel I ✨ shine <strong>best</strong> in that dynamic in
        the project, so this really was perfect for me. I hope releasing NixOS
        has <strong>felt</strong> better for those involved. With the seeds
        I’ve planted it should continue to bloom this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to thank <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/disassembler">Samuel Leathers</a>,
        my co-release manager, for his congruent effervescence and guidance;
        <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/grahamc">Graham Christensen</a> for his organizational encouragement;
        and obviously every last person I got to work with. Thanks ✌️
      </p>
      <p>
        In leisure, pause, and experimental grace.

    <description>
      A <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">serious security
        vulnerability</a> has been discovered in OpenSSL. All stable
      NixOS releases prior to version
      <strong>13.10.35708.15a465c</strong> are vulnerable. (You can
      see your current version by running <tt>nixos-version</tt>.) To
      upgrade to the latest NixOS version, run <tt>nixos-rebuild
        switch --upgrade</tt>. You can verify whether you are safe by
      running

      <pre class="terminal-console">
$ nix-store -qR /run/current-system | grep openssl

      If this shows any OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1g, you may be

      NixOS 13.10 released
    </title>
    <description>
      We have released NixOS 13.10, the first stable branch of NixOS.
      Its goal is to provide a safe branch for production environments
      that need bug fixes and security updates, but not the
      potentially destabilising changes that sometimes occur on the
      unstable branch. You can get NixOS 13.10 ISOs and VirtualBox
      appliances from the <a href="/download.html">download
        page</a>. See the <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200423231710/https://releases.nixos.org/nix-dev/2013-October/011941.html">announcement</a>
      for more information. For information on how to switch an
      existing NixOS machine from the unstable channel to 13.10, check
      out the <a href="/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading">manual

      The paper <a href="https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/decvms-issre2010-final.pdf">“Automating System
        Tests Using Declarative Virtual Machines”</a> (by Sander van der
      Burg and Eelco Dolstra) has been accepted for presentation at
      the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110726193652/http://www.issre2010.org/">21st IEEE International
        Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2010)</a>.
      It describes how system tests with complex requirements on the
      environment (such as remote machines, network topologies, system
      services or root privileges) can be written succinctly using <a
        href="https://svn.nixos.org/websvn/nix/nixos/trunk/tests/bittorrent.nix">declarative
        specifications</a> of the machines needed by the test
      environment. From these specifications we can automatically
      instantiate (networks of) virtual machines. This is what we use
      for <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixos/trunk/jobstatus">automated
        regression testing of NixOS itself</a>. A <a

      NixOS now supports <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a>, a
      modern, light-weight desktop environment. It can be enabled by
      setting the NixOS configuration value
      <tt>services.xserver.desktopManager.xfce.enable</tt> to
      <tt>true</tt>. (<a href="/images/screenshots/nixos-xfce.png">Screenshot</a>)

      We now have a fairly complete set of KDE 4.2 packages in Nixpkgs
      and NixOS. Previously we had KDE 3.5, but it was rather
      incomplete: just <tt>kdelibs</tt> and <tt>kdebase</tt>.
      Now we have all that desktop goodness, such as
      <tt>kdemultimedia</tt>, <tt>kdenetwork</tt> and <tt>kdegames</tt>.
      You can enable KDE 4 in NixOS by setting the
      <tt>services.xserver.sessionType</tt> option to
      <tt>kde4</tt>. Thanks go to Yury G. Kudryashov, Andrew
      Morsillo and Sander van der Burg for doing the hard work on

      several advantages over the old build farm: the build tasks for
      a project are scheduled and published separately, so that for
      instance a (fast) tarball build doesn’t have to wait for a
      (slow) Cygwin build; build results are stored in a database,
      which will enable all sorts of interesting queries; better error
      reporting; a better web interface; and much more. We have

          International Conference on Functional Programming</a> (ICFP).
        It describes NixOS in much greater detail than last year’s

        features such as laziness are important for system
        configuration management. It also provides some measurements

        <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> now runs on NixOS!
        Finally we can run all those <a href="/images/screenshots/nixos-games.png">legacy
          applications</a>... Thanks to Michael Raskin for adding Wine
        and a NPTL-enabled Glibc (which Wine seems to need). This is a
        nice application of purely functional package composition, by
        the way: Wine didn’t work with the standard Glibc in Nixpkgs, so
        we just <a
          href="https://svn.nixos.org/viewvc/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix?r1=9165&amp;r2=9164&amp;pathrev=9165">pass
          it another Glibc at build time</a>.</p>

      <p>In other news, Nix 0.11
        and Nixpkgs 0.11 will be released soon.</p>

      NixOS is now <em>almost</em> usable as a desktop OS ;-). We
      have an X server, a bunch of Gnome packages, basic wireless
      support, and of course all the applications in Nixpkgs that we
      had all along running on other Linux distributions. Here are a
      few screenshots:

        Eelco Visser: new
        hardware for buildfarm at Delft University of Technology has
        arrived.</p>

      <p>Here’s what we have: 5 Intel Core 2 Duo DualCore machines
        with 1GB RAM, 2 Mac minis with 1,83-GHz Intel Core
        Duo-processor, another Core 2 Duo a UPS to deal with spikes in
        power supply, a console with integrated monitor and keyboard
        switches, a rack with room for a couple more machines.</p>

      <p>Here’s what we’re going to do with the goodies. The five
        Intel machines and the two MacMinis (also Intel) are going to
        be used to crank at building hundreds of software
        packages. Using virtualisation we should be able to run builds
        on multiple operating system distributions. <a href="https://eelcovisser.org/blog/2007/01/23/bootfarm/">Read

      Secure sharing paper accepted for ASE 2005

      The paper “Secure Sharing Between Untrusted Users in a
      Transparent Source/Binary Deployment Model” has been accepted at
      <a href="http://www.ase-conference.org/">ASE 2005</a>. This
      paper describes how a Nix store can be securely shared by
      multiple users who may not trust each other; i.e., how do we
      prevent one user from installing a Trojan horse that is
      subsequently executed by some other user?

      The paper “Service Configuration Management” (accepted at the
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200422192338/https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/scm12/">12th
        International Workshop on Software Configuration
        Management</a>) describes how we can rather easily deploy
      “services” (e.g., complete webserver configurations such as our
      <a href="http://svn.nixos.org/">Subversion server</a>) through
      Nix by treating the non-component parts (such as configuration
      files, control scripts and static data) as components that are
      built by Nix expressions. The result is that all advantages
      that Nix offers to software deployment also extend to service
      deployment, such as the ability to easily have multiple
      configuration side by side, to roll back configurations, and to
      identify the precise dependencies of a configuration.

        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090712101213/https://www.sei.cmu.edu/pacc/CBSE2005/">CBSE 2005</a>.
      It describes how we can deploy updates to Nix packages
      efficiently, even if “fundamental” packages like Glibc are
      updated (which cause a rebuild of all dependent packages), by
      deploying binary patches between components in the Nix store.
      Includes techniques such as patch chaining and computing deltas
      between archive files.

<strong>Warning:</strong> Disnix is a research project, fairly bleeding edge and
not yet recommended for use in production environments.

<p>
The easiest way to obtain Disnix is to use NixOS and by activating
the Disnix module in the NixOS configuration file:
</p>
<pre>

To use Disnix on different distributions
or systems, a release has to be downloaded and installed on a

  <p>
    They have no special responsibility with regard to the content of an RFC,
    they can weigh in on them, the same as any other community member, but are
    only in charge of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>selecting the Shepherds unanimously</li>
    <li>supervising that the Shepherds are carrying out their work</li>
    <li>committing the final RFC</li>
  </ul>



  <h2>Shepherd Team</h2>

  <p>
    A team of 3-4 community members defined unanimously by the RFC Steering
    Committee, responsible for accepting or rejecting a specific RFC. This team
    is created per RFC from community members nominated in the discussion on
    that RFC.
  </p>

  <p>
    This team should be people who are very familiar with the main components
    touched by the RFC. The author cannot be part of the Shepherd Team. In
    addition, at most half of the Shepherd Team can be part of the RFC Steering
    Committee.
  </p>

  <p>
    The responsibility of the team is to guide the discussion as long as it is
    constructive, new points are brought up and the RFC is iterated on and from
    time to time summarise the current state of discussion. If this is the case
    no longer, then the Shepherd Team shall step in with a motion for FCP.
  </p>

  <h2>Shepherd Leader</h2>

  <p>
    The person in charge of the RFC process for a specific RFC, and responsible
    for ensuring the process is followed in a timely fashion. The Shepherd Leader
    has no special responsibility with regard to moving an undecided Shepherd
    Team to a certain decision.

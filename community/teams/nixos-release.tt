  release manager having managed two releases steps down and the release
  management team of the last release appoints a new release manager.

  <p>
    This makes sure a release management team always consists of one release
    manager who already has managed one release and one release manager being
    introduced to their role, making it easier to pass on knowledge and
    experience.

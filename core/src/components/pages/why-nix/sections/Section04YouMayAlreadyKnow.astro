  If you are already familiar with modern build and infrasctructure tools, the
  following table highlights how Nix's declarative and functional approach
  aligns with concepts you may already know, while also showcasing the unique
  benefits that Nix brings to the table.

  It is important to note that while this table positions Nix as an alternative
  to these tools, Nix can also complement and integrate with them, enhancing
  their capabilities through its unique approach to package and environment
  management. The strength of Nix lies in its ability to provide a consistent
  and reliable foundation, regardless of the specific tools or ecosystems in
  use.

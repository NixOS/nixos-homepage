            Due to its steep learning curve and niche popularity in comparison
            to other package managers, finding experienced Nix users may be more
            challenging. However, the Nix community is active and growing, with
            many resources available for learning and support. Investing in
            training and development can help build a skilled team over time.

            Creating and maintaining Nix expressions for packages can require
            additional effort. Projects with many different dependencies,
            multiple build tools or build processes that require an active
            internet connection may require significant initial setup and
            ongoing maintenance.

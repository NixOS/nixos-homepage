    <Quotation>
      <p>
        Communities form when different people unite around a common purpose.
        Shared values guide decision making, and community goals supersede
        individual interests and agendas.

      Values are <span class="italic">not</span> a Code of Conduct, they do not define
      governance structures, and they do not provide specific policies. Instead,
      values inform the decisions we make about these things. A good test for <a

    <Quotation>
      If a statement can be invoked by anyone in an organization, and cause a
      decision to be re-evaluated or changed, without regard to anyoneâ€™s rank or
      title, then you have a bona fide [i.e. genuine] value. If it doesnâ€™t work
      that way, then itâ€™s not a value.
    </Quotation>

    <p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed font-extralight">
      To apply in many situations, values must be high-level, abstract concepts.
      Therefore, in the text below, each value is presented as a heading
      followed by an elaboration of its meaning. This is meant as a starting
      point for interpretation, not a comprehensive definition. The heading and
      the elaboration have equal importance.

        We treat each other with respect and civility. No matter one's
        individual identity, circumstances, level of contribution to the
        project, or status, everyone has the right to respect, and everyone has
        the duty to treat others with respect. We prioritise project health over
        individual interests. People with higher visibility within the project
        or towards the public are subject to higher expectations for their
        conduct.

        We are here, first and foremost, as individuals working together. Our
        priority here is to work on Nix projects for the benefit of all their
        contributors and users. We value building excellent software with a
        vibrant and diverse community. Individuals gain trust and status by
        doing the work. Organisations gain prestige by funding the work of
        individuals and providing resources to support the project.

        Nix projects are and will always remain <a

        Free software is our priority, but we also support our users' needs to
        use non-free software, when practical.

      <p>
        We are a synthesis of varied but overlapping communities. We rely on
        distributed approaches: asynchronous communication, clear ownership,
        deep-dive taskforces, and local decisionmaking. We focus our attention
        on working together on our shared goals and working separately in a
        non-interfering way when our goals are independent. We build trust
        primarily by working together on Nix projects.

        Automation over process and toil

            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240717145635/https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/"
            >Toil</a
          > is work that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, interrupt-driven,
          devoid of enduring value, and scaling linearly with growth.
        </Citation>
      </h3>

      <p>
        We are a global community, and disseminating information and maintaining
        processes can be difficult. We are also a large project with a lot of
        hard and repetitive work. Therefore, we value automation over toil,
        while recognizing that not all toil can be automated. Automation reduces
        toil, but people are still accountable. Adding new toil needs a very
        strong justification. We build automation and processes that make the
        best use of our contributors' limited time and energy.

        Stable evolution over stagnation or chaos
        <a href="#community-values-stability" class="text-lg">ðŸ”—</a>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Openness to new ideas and evolution is part of what made Nix great. We
        continue to foster that evolution while encouraging development of
        re-usable building blocks and well-defined, stable interfaces. We value
        experimenting with designs and concepts, and folding successful
        experiments back into continuous improvement for stable components. The
        larger the impact an action has, the more care and discussion is
        warranted before taking the action. Our leaders have a duty to find,
        support, and promote new contributors â€” and eventually step aside for
        new leaders.

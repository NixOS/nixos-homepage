        <p>
          Communities form when different people unite around a common purpose.
          Shared values guide decision making, and community goals supersede
          individual interests and agendas.

        across the community, keeping us moving in a common direction. This

      <p>
        Values are <span class="italic">not</span> a Code of Conduct, they do not
        define governance structures, and they do not provide specific policies.
        Instead, values inform the decisions we make about these things. A good test
        for <a
          href="https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/our-values-1fc02b53598"
          >whether something is a value</a

      </p>

      <Quotation dark>
        If a statement can be invoked by anyone in an organization, and cause a
        decision to be re-evaluated or changed, without regard to anyoneâ€™s rank
        or title, then you have a bona fide [i.e. genuine] value. If it doesnâ€™t
        work that way, then itâ€™s not a value.
      </Quotation>

      <p>
        To apply in many situations, values must be high-level, abstract
        concepts. Therefore, in the text below, each value is presented as a
        heading followed by an elaboration of its meaning. This is meant as a
        starting point for interpretation, not a comprehensive definition. The
        heading and the elaboration have equal importance.

        the duty to treat others with respect. We prioritise project health over

        or towards the public are subject to higher expectations for their

        vibrant and diverse community. Individuals gain trust and status by

        on working together on our shared goals and working separately in a
        non-interfering way when our goals are independent. We build trust
        primarily by working together on Nix projects.

        Automation over process and toil

            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240717145635/https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/"

        </Citation>
      </h4>

      <p>
        We are a global community, and disseminating information and maintaining
        processes can be difficult. We are also a large project with a lot of
        hard and repetitive work. Therefore, we value automation over toil,
        while recognizing that not all toil can be automated. Automation reduces
        toil, but people are still accountable. Adding new toil needs a very
        strong justification. We build automation and processes that make the
        best use of our contributors' limited time and energy.

        Stable evolution over stagnation or chaos

      <p>
        Openness to new ideas and evolution is part of what made Nix great. We
        continue to foster that evolution while encouraging development of
        re-usable building blocks and well-defined, stable interfaces. We value
        experimenting with designs and concepts, and folding successful
        experiments back into continuous improvement for stable components. The
        larger the impact an action has, the more care and discussion is
        warranted before taking the action. Our leaders have a duty to find,
        support, and promote new contributors â€” and eventually step aside for
        new leaders.

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract in a common, machine-readable format, either for yourself or to transmit to a third party.

  <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If you have objected to processing under Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Newsletter</h2>

<h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
<p>If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we require an email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address and that you agree to receive the newsletter. No further data is collected, or only on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not share it with third parties.</p>

<p>The processing of the data entered into the newsletter registration form is based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the email address, and its use for sending the newsletter at any time—for example, via the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The legality of any data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected.</p>

<p>The data you provide to us for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after the newsletter is canceled or its purpose ceases to exist. We reserve the right to delete or block email addresses from our newsletter list at our discretion in accordance with our legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

<p>Data stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.</p>

<p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist by us or the newsletter service provider if necessary to prevent future mailings. The data in the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and not merged with other data. This is in both your interest and ours in complying with legal requirements for newsletter distribution (legitimate interest as per Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not time-limited. <strong>You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>

**Official Partnership between NixOS Foundation and [Framework](https://frame.work/)**

**TL;DR:** Since April 2025, The NixOS Foundation and Framework are officially partnering to improve NixOS support on Framework devices. This formalizes earlier community efforts, enabling selected community members to contribute to testing, documentation, and support for current and future hardware.

## From Community Effort to Official Partnership

We're excited to announce that the collaboration between the NixOS Foundation and Framework is evolving: what started as a community-led initiative has become an official partnership.

This step also strengthens the relationship between Framework and the NixOS Foundation, with a shared focus on improving hardware support for NixOS on Framework devices both for existing and upcoming devices.

## Why we decided to move from a community-led partnership to an official one

The collaboration between NixOS community members and Framework was a great starting point and showed what’s possible when passionate individuals come together. But naturally, such efforts are limited by the time and availability of just a few people. To build stronger, long-term relationships with hardware vendors and grow more industrial partnerships, we need to offer reliability and professional coordination. An official partnership gives manufacturers the confidence that the collaboration will continue beyond individual contributions, increasing the chances that NixOS could become an officially supported Linux distribution and allowing us to expand into new areas together.

## What this means for the community

This partnership combines efforts to improve NixOS compatibility with Framework hardware in a more structured way. Selected community members and members of the hardware team can contribute to testing, documentation, and support, helping to enhance NixOS support on Framework devices and build a stronger partnership with Framework.

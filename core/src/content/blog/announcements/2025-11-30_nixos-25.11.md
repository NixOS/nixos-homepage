Hey everyone, we are [jopejoe1](https://github.com/jopejoe1) and [Leona Maroni](https://github.com/leona-ya), the release managers of the newest release of NixOS. We are very proud to announce the public availability of NixOS 25.11 "Xantusia".

NixOS is a Linux distribution. Its underlying package repository Nixpkgs can also be used on other Linux systems and macOS with the Nix package manager.

This release will receive bugfixes and security updates for seven months (up until 2026-06-30).
The old release 25.05 "Warbler" is now officially deprecated and will reach its end-of-life and stop receiving security updates after 2025-12-31.

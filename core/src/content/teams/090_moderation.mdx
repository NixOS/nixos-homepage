This team is responsible for moderating participation on [official community
platforms](/community/#platforms) in accord with [RFC
102](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0102-moderation-team.md).
More information can be found at [the team's GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NixOS/moderation).

## Reporting issues

The preferred way to contact the team is via private message on the
[NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/) using the
[`@moderators`](https://discourse.nixos.org/g/moderators) group. This
allows any member of the team to respond and participate.
Alternatively, you can contact us via
[email](mailto:moderation@nixos.org), or reach to any of the current
team members individually via Matrix.

A fast, but public, way of contacting the team is the
[`#moderation:nixos.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#moderation:nixos.org)
Matrix channel.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident.

Designated platform moderators are usually in charge, but authority may be
delegated to one or more members of the broader team.

The CUDA team is responsible for everything related to
[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) in
[Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

## Motivation

GPU-acceleration has become a fundamental prerequisite to machine learning work
and scientific computing. Without support for GPU-acceleration, the Nixpkgs
ecosystem will remain largely invisible to practitioners.

Nixpkgs and NixOS give us the tools we need to build reproducile and robust
packages and environments. However, the state of scientific computing in
Nixpkgs does not reflect this.

## Goals and Responsibilities

The singular focus of the CUDA-maintainers team is to make Nixpkgs the best
repository of packages leveraging CUDA, especially in machine learning and
scientific computing. Towards that end, we seek to:

- improve the quantity and quality of CUDA-enabled package in Nixpkgs
- document CUDA packaging best practices, guidelines, and patterns
- support community efforts involving packaging or distributing CUDA-enabled
  software

## Call for Sponsors

The CUDA-maintainers team is seeking sponsors to help fund or upply technical
infrastructure related to our mission. Therefore, if you or your organization:

- are impacted by these issues,
- have related issues with Nixpkgs CUDA support,
- would like to prioritize or accelerate certain work,

Please consider supporting this effort directly or through the NixOS Foundation.
Reach out via GitHub [@connorbaker](https://github.com/connorbaker), or email
connorbaker01@gmail.com to get involved.

Discussions are held on Matrix, Discourse, and on GitHub issues and pull
requests.

The board is a partner with the Nix Steering Committee (SC) in leadership and is primarily focused on corporate and general external relationships, fiscals/financials, legals and partnerships.

In particular, its responsibilities are to:

- Own and handle the administrative and legal
  - Serve as an interface between the community and the corporate/governmental/financial world
  - Manage trademarks
- Handle external relationships, partnerships, and donations
  - Work with the SC to establish foundation policies that balance the interests of volunteers, commercial actors, and public institutions, while staying within legal and administrative feasibility constraints. Both the SC and the board need to approve such policies. This includes sponsorship eligibility and trademark policies.
  - Build and maintain beneficial and collaborative relationships
  - Maintain and support grants/grant providers
- Provide a framework for the community to self-organise:
  - Handle payments for tooling, meetups, and infrastructure
  - Manage credentials and permissions
  - Review and approve constitution changes affecting the board's authority, responsibilities, or appointment procedures.
- Own and be responsible for financials
  - Provide fiscal planning and funding for community events and efforts
  - Decide how much funding is available for each broadly scoped type of events and efforts, while the SC decides the priorities within these scopes and limits of the allocated funds

See the [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md) for more information on leadership.

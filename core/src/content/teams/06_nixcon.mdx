NixCon returns for its 10th edition - September 5 - 7, 2025, at OST in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland. What began in 2015 as a humble gathering has become a celebration of reproducibility, collaboration, and community care.

This year, we come together under the theme of bridge-building - connecting people, projects, and perspectives. With talks, workshops, an open hackcentre, and a dedicated hackday, NixCon welcomes all: from curious newcomers to long-time contributors.

Attending and organizing NixCon is a unique and special experience - unlike any other OS or FOSS event. It's where the technical meets the personal, and where we co-create not just software, but belonging.

Letâ€™s build the future of Nix, together.

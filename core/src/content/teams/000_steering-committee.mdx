The SC is responsible for guiding projects in alignment with Nix Community Values.
It has the following responsibilities, which it may delegate as appropriate:

- Project Direction:
  - Guide the direction of projects when necessary, ensuring that decisions are made explicit, along with their origins.
  - Ensure project decisions get made in a timely manner as far as possible.
  - If unavoidable, ensure that decisions are explicitly marked as stalled and recommend follow-up times or conditions.
- Decision-Making:
  - Ensure the existence and functionality of processes for regular decision-making within the community.
  - Maintain effective escalation points for issues that require further attention.
    - Decision authority may be delegated to other teams when significant analysis is needed, but the SC remains responsible if the delegated team fails to reach a decision.
  - Evolve the constitution, including governance structures and processes, as needed, subject to supermajority approval.
- Coordination with the NixOS Foundation Board:
  - Collaborate with the NixOS Foundation Board to set policies and priorities for high-visibility actions, events, and resources under the Foundation's care. Both the SC and the board need to approve such policies.
  - Any delegation of responsibilities related to these areas also delegates communication with the Board on the relevant topics.
  - Be involved in the [board composition change process](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#board-composition-changes#board-composition-changes)
- Creation and Management of Teams:
  - Establish and manage teams to delegate authority on specific areas.
    - Specify formal decision procedures for teams.
  - Delegate authority to long-term teams and committees, allowing them to evolve policies as needed.
  - Form short-term teams to analyze arguments and reach a decision on contentious issues.
- Management of Official Resources:
  - Decide which resources are considered official
  - Oversee and manage official resources, including public communication channels and technical infrastructure.
  - Create and enforce appropriate rules for Nix project spaces, including issuing Nix-wide bans, which will affect voter eligibility.
  - Ensure the existence and proper execution of processes for granting access to projects and resources.
  - As of the establishment of the SC, [official resources](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/resources.md) and access details are listed in the repository.

  See the [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md) for more information on leadership.

  <Quotation>
    <p>
      Communities form when different people unite around a common purpose.
      Shared values guide decision making, and community goals supersede
      individual interests and agendas.

    Values are <span class="italic">not</span> a Code of Conduct, they do not define
    governance structures, and they do not provide specific policies. Instead, values
    inform the decisions we make about these things. A good test for <Link

  </p>

  <Quotation>
    If a statement can be invoked by anyone in an organization, and cause a
    decision to be re-evaluated or changed, without regard to anyoneâ€™s rank or
    title, then you have a bona fide [i.e. genuine] value. If it doesnâ€™t work
    that way, then itâ€™s not a value.
  </Quotation>

  <p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
    To apply in many situations, values must be high-level, abstract concepts.
    Therefore, in the text below, each value is presented as a heading followed
    by an elaboration of its meaning. This is meant as a starting point for
    interpretation, not a comprehensive definition. The heading and the
    elaboration have equal importance.

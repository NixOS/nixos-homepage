    <p>
      We treat each other with respect and civility. No matter one's individual
      identity, circumstances, level of contribution to the project, or status,
      everyone has the right to respect, and everyone has the duty to treat
      others with respect. We prioritise project health over individual
      interests. People with higher visibility within the project or towards the
      public are subject to higher expectations for their conduct.

    <p>
      We are here, first and foremost, as individuals working together. Our
      priority here is to work on Nix projects for the benefit of all their
      contributors and users. We value building excellent software with a
      vibrant and diverse community. Individuals gain trust and status by doing
      the work. Organisations gain prestige by funding the work of individuals
      and providing resources to support the project.

      Nix projects are and will always remain <a

      >. We value working together with the broader free software community.
      Free software is our priority, but we also support our users' needs to use
      non-free software, when practical.

    </h3>

    <p>
      We are a synthesis of varied but overlapping communities. We rely on
      distributed approaches: asynchronous communication, clear ownership,
      deep-dive taskforces, and local decisionmaking. We focus our attention on
      working together on our shared goals and working separately in a
      non-interfering way when our goals are independent. We build trust
      primarily by working together on Nix projects.

      Automation over process and toil
      <a href="#community-values-automation" class="text-lg">ðŸ”—</a>
      <Citation id={1} onBlueBackground>
        <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240717145635/https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/"
          >Toil</a
        > is work that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, interrupt-driven,
        devoid of enduring value, and scaling linearly with growth.
      </Citation>
    </h3>

    <p>
      We are a global community, and disseminating information and maintaining
      processes can be difficult. We are also a large project with a lot of hard
      and repetitive work. Therefore, we value automation over toil, while
      recognizing that not all toil can be automated. Automation reduces toil,
      but people are still accountable. Adding new toil needs a very strong
      justification. We build automation and processes that make the best use of
      our contributors' limited time and energy.

      Stable evolution over stagnation or chaos
      <a href="#community-values-stability" class="text-lg">ðŸ”—</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Openness to new ideas and evolution is part of what made Nix great. We
      continue to foster that evolution while encouraging development of
      re-usable building blocks and well-defined, stable interfaces. We value
      experimenting with designs and concepts, and folding successful
      experiments back into continuous improvement for stable components. The
      larger the impact an action has, the more care and discussion is warranted
      before taking the action. Our leaders have a duty to find, support, and
      promote new contributors â€” and eventually step aside for new leaders.

# Responsibility

The role of the board is to provide operational and organizational support to the NixOS project and community. In particular, its responsibilities are to:

- Handle the administrative, legal and financial tasks of the foundation
- Serve as an interface between the community and the corporate/governmental world:
  - Handle sponsoring and donations
  - Build and maintain beneficial and collaborative relationships
- Provide a framework for teams to self-organize:
  - Hand out the credentials and permissions required for the teams' work
- Fund community events and efforts
- Unblock things that would be stuck otherwise, and serve as:
  - Arbiter in case of conflicts
  - Backup for critical tasks when needed

The board is not responsible for technical leadership, decisions, or direction.

The CUDA team is responsible for everything related to
[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) in
[Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

## Motivation

GPU-acceleration has become a fundamental prerequisite to machne learning work
and scientific computing. Without support for GPU-acceleration, the Nixpkgs
ecosystem will remain largely invisible to practitioners.

Nixpkgs and NixOS give us the tools we need to build reproducile and robust
packages and environments. However, the state of scientific computing in
Nixpkgs does not reflect this.

## Goals and Responsibilities

The singular focus of the CUDA-maintainers team is to make Nixkgs the best
repository of packages leveraging CUDA, especially in machine learning and
scientific computing. Towards that end, we seek to:

- improve the quantity and quality of CUDA-enabled package in ixpkgs
- document CUDA packaging best practices, guidelines, and pattrns
- support community efforts involving packaging or distributin CUDA-enabled
  software

## Call for Sponsors

The CUDA-maintainers team is seeking sponsors to help fund or upply technical
infrastructure related to our mission. Therefore, if you or your organization:

- are impacted by these issues,
- have related issues with Nixpkgs CUDA support,
- would like to prioritize or accelerate certain work,

Please consider supporting this effort directly or through theNixOS Foundation.
Reach out via GitHub [@connorbaker](https://github.com/connorbaker), or email
connor.baker@tweag.io to get involved.

## Contact and Information

Discussions are held on Matrix, Discourse, and on GitHub issues and pull
requests.

For each release there are two release managers. After each release the release manager having managed two releases steps down and the release management team of the last release appoints a new release manager.

The team structure makes sure a release management team always consists of one release manager who already has managed one release and one release manager being introduced to their role, making it easier to pass on knowledge and experience.

## Responsibilities

*   Manage the release process
*   Start discussions about features and changes for a given release
*   Create a roadmap
*   Release in cooperation with Eelco Dolstra
*   Decide which bug fixes, features, etc... get back ported after a release

## Release process

# Sources of Security Information

Security is a priority for the NixOS community. A variety of channels are used to coordinate development in this vein. Three of the main modes of communication about NixOS security are:

- The issues tagged "Security" on [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%221.severity%3A+security%22)
- The [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#security:nixos.org)
- The NixOS security [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/dev/security)

In addition to community-sourced developments, NixOS has a dedicated security team. If the above sources are not enough to answer your question, please reach out to the team.

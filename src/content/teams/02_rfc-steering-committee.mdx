# Responsibility

This committee is responsible for forming an RFC Shepherd team from the available nominations on each RFC. This team also names the leader of the Shepherd team.

They have no special responsibility with regard to the content of an RFC; they can weigh in on them, the same as any other community member, but are only in charge of:

- Selecting the Shepherds unanimously
- Supervising that the Shepherds are carrying out their work
- Committing the final RFC

# Shepherd Team

A team of 3-4 community members defined unanimously by the RFC Steering Committee, responsible for accepting or rejecting a specific RFC. This team is created per RFC from community members nominated in the discussion on that RFC.

This team should be people who are very familiar with the main components touched by the RFC. The author cannot be part of the Shepherd Team. In addition, at most half of the Shepherd Team can be part of the RFC Steering Committee.

The responsibility of the team is to guide the discussion as long as it is constructive, new points are brought up, and the RFC is iterated on. From time to time, they should summarize the current state of discussion. If this is no longer the case, then the Shepherd Team shall step in with a motion for FCP.

# Shepherd Leader

The person in charge of the RFC process for a specific RFC, responsible for ensuring the process is followed in a timely fashion. The Shepherd Leader has no special responsibility with regard to moving an undecided Shepherd Team to a certain decision.

The geospatial team is responsible for everything related to geospatial software in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

We're keeping widely used packages and modules up to date, and package new software regularly.
Please ping us if you need help with reviews or build failures.

If you like [what we do](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/projects/47/views/5?filterQuery=status%3A%22%E2%9C%85+Done%22), please let us know.

If you want to join the geospatial team, add yourself to the geospatial team in the [Nixpkgs team list](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/team-list.nix).
Create PR with short introduction of yourself and assign it to one of the other members.

We are the Nix marketing team, and our mission to help grow the Nix user base.

## Why we want growth

Growth is instrumental to something. What is that?

We strive to advance the state of the art in software engineering. That's why
we're using and contributing to Nix.

Ultimately, we're interested in using and making software that is:

- more up-to-date
- more reliable
- easier to distribute
- easier to integrate
- easier to collaborate on.

We cannot achieve this alone. As the Nix marketing team, we believe that
talking about work done is as important as doing the work. This is where we can
help the Nix ecosystem to thrive.

We're convinced that the more people *know about* Nix, the more people will
*use* Nix, and the more people will become *contributors and maintainers*. We
want to serve those people who are indispensable for maintaining and developing
the Nix ecosystem, by promoting their work and facilitating communication with
a wider audience.

## How we want to grow

Our strategy is for the Nix ecosystem to become known for something unique we
already excel at. This is what we will emphasize in order to attract users.

This is not to set directions for development, but simply recognizing and
leveraging current strengths.

### Target audience

Our target audience are software developers.

Nix tooling already fits developer use cases most closely, and it is developers
who will derive the most value from using Nix in its current state. Developers
are also more likely to become contributors, and eventually maintainers.
Finally, among our users, software professionals have the greatest influence on
organizations that can provide the resources necessary to keep developing and
maintaining the Nix ecosystem.

### Communication strategy

Nix can do many things. If we start to talk about all of those things at once,
the message gets lost.

For example: There is only a limited amount of space on the landing page. We
will choose a narrow set of topics that best serve our purpose of increasing
adoption most effectively. The particular focus may change over time as we move
through the [adoption life
cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) for our
target audience.

## How to measure growth

In order to know where we're going, we need to know where we are.

Therefore, we will first collect metrics relevant to our mission, separated
into phases in the user journey:

### Discovery phase

- Google Search trends
- Social media impressions
- Visits to the landing page

### User phase

- Number of members and messages on the community platforms (Discourse, Matrix,
  GitHub)
- Binary cache usage
- Number of queries on search.nixos.org
- Website statistics on documentation
- Community surveys

### Contribution phase

- Number of contributors and forks
- Number of opened issues and pull requests

## Supporting contributors and community teams with outreach

If you're working on improving the Nix ecosystem, the marketing team is there to help you reach your audience.

## 3-months plan (June through August 2023)

The current team consists of 5 people with regular availability of ca. 2 hours
per week for working on marketing topics. We estimate the required work to

## Get in touch

We are looking for additional members. We are especially interested in people
interested in frontend development, content creation for social media, and
technical writing.

We would like to see the team being assembled from every corner of a Nix
community. To join the team please write an email to
[webmaster@nixos.org](mailto:webmaster@nixos.org) trying to answer the
following questions:

- Why would you like to join the team?
- Why are you interested in marketing Nix?
- What drives you?
- How would you contribute to the marketing team?
- What is your idea of what the marketing team will work on, this year? Next
  year? Next 5 years?
- What could be a few easy fixes to the website that would solve problems that
  you heard others complain about Nix/NixOS?

The answers are actually not used to judge people if they are good enough to
join, but to understand the person joining, their intent and their vision.
Since we will discuss many things that could be very bikeshedding, it is
important that we understand each otherâ€™s position and the context they are
arguing from.

## Meetings

You can expect at meetings to discuss things first in an abstract manner (what
are our goals) and only then get into more concrete proposals (how do we
achieve goals). Meetings will be scheduled as needed and as much as the team
has time, but at least once a month. Initially, it might happen that we will
meet more often until the whole idea of what a marketing team is/does is
bootstrapped. Minutes of the meetings will be published with the potential
agenda and the date of the next meeting.

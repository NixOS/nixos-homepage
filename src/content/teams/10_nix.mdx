This includes, but isn’t limited to:

- Enable contributors
- Ensure capacity for reviewing PRs and addressing issues
- Define and assert quality criteria for contributions
- Keep code healthy, documentation up to date
- Manage the release lifecycle
- Regularly publish reports on work done
- Engage with third parties in the interest of the project

## Meetings

The Nix team has a weekly meeting to triage and discuss issues and PRs, and a
weekly working session to review PRs and hack on code.

 [![NixOS installer online help](/images/screenshots/nixos-installer-help.png)](/images/screenshots/nixos-installer-help.png) New NixOS installation CD images for i686 and x86\_64 are [available](https://web.archive.org/web/20200423231710/https://releases.nixos.org/nixos-0.1pre10083/), which is a good thing as the previous ones were already a few months old. The new images are Nix 0.11-based, contain [Memtest86+](http://www.memtest.org/) as a convenience, should support more SATA drives, and show online help (the [NixOS manual](/manual/nixos/unstable/)) on virtual console 7.

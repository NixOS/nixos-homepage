### A New Chapter for the NixOS Foundation

On March 4th, 2025, we welcomed a new NixOS Foundation Board — marking the first-ever board rotation under our newly established [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/23b3af2f7a3240c6a5343f3234e8e0befe26b7a0/doc/constitution.md). Change is always a big step, but we believe this one is for the better! With clearly defined roles and a more structured approach, the Foundation is set up for success in supporting the Nix & NixOS ecosystem.

Following a thorough selection process, carefully coordinated with [the Steering Committee](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/23b3af2f7a3240c6a5343f3234e8e0befe26b7a0/doc/governance.md#governance), the new board members are:

- President/Chair: [Ron Efroni Rotman](https://github.com/refroni) (continuing role)
- Secretary:[ Silvan Mosberger](https://github.com/infinisil)
- Director of Legal Affairs: [Ryan Trinkle](https://github.com/ryantrinkle)
- Treasurer: [Maximilian Habryka](https://github.com/Lassulus)
- Director of Community Support: [Sebastian Kraus](https://github.com/Ra33it0)

This team is at the heart of the Foundation’s mission — to strengthen and support the Nix & NixOS community.

### A Huge Thank You

To everyone who participated — whether by nominating, giving feedback, or simply showing support—your engagement made this possible. Seeing so many community members step up to contribute has been truly inspiring!

### What’s Next?

- Legal Handover – The transition process with the KVK in Utrecht is underway.
- Onboarding & Operations – In the coming weeks and months, we’ll focus on getting the new board fully onboarded and operational.

Looking forward to an exciting future — together!

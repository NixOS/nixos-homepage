The paper “Atomic Upgrading of Distributed Systems” (by Sander van der Burg, Eelco Dolstra and Merijn de Jonge) has been accepted for presentation at the [First ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Upgrades (HotSWUp)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090525100630/http://www.hotswup.org/). A [draft of the paper](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/atomic-hotswup2008-submitted.pdf) is available. It describes Sander’s master’s thesis research on DisNix, an extension to Nix that allows deployment and upgrading of distributed systems from a single declarative description. We will continue this research in the [Jacquard PDS project](http://swerl.tudelft.nl/bin/view/Main/PDS), which has now started. (We still have an opening for a PhD student or a postdoc; please [contact us](mailto:visser@acm.org) if you’re interested.)

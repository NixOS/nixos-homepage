We're pleased to announce the availability of Nix 2.7.0. It will be available from [NixOS - Getting Nix / NixOS](https://nixos.org/download).

Here are the release notes:

*   Nix will now make some helpful suggestions when you mistype something on the command line. For instance, if you type nix build `nixpkgs#thunderbrd`, it will suggest `thunderbird`.
*   A number of “default” flake output attributes have been renamed. These are:

    *   `defaultPackage.<system>` → `packages.<system>.default`
    *   `defaultApps.<system>` → `apps.<system>.default`
    *   `defaultTemplate` → `templates.default`
    *   `defaultBundler.<system>` → `bundlers.<system>.default`
    *   `overlay` → `overlays.default`
    *   `devShell.<system>` → `devShells.<system>.default`

    The old flake output attributes still work, but `nix flake check` will warn about them.

*   Breaking API change: `nix bundle` now supports bundlers of the form `bundler.<system>.<name>= derivation: another-derivation;`. This supports additional functionality to inspect evaluation information during bundling. A new repository 73 has various bundlers implemented.
*   `nix store ping` now reports the version of the remote Nix daemon.
*   `nix flake {init,new}` now display information about which files have been created.
*   Templates can now define a `welcomeText` attribute, which is printed out by `nix flake {init,new} --template <template>`.

The next release 149 is scheduled for . The [next release](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/milestone/16) is scheduled for 2022-04-18.

Thank you to all the contributors!

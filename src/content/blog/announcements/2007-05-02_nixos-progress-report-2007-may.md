 [![KDE logo](../../../assets/image/klogo-official-crystal-128x128.png)](https://www.kde.org) We now have [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) running on NixOS ([obligatory screenshot](../../../assets/image/screenshots/nixos-kde.png)). Just kdebase for now (Martin Bravenboer already added kdelibs a long time ago so that we could run the wonderful [KCachegrind](http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi)), but it contains all the important stuff (Konqueror, KDesktop, Kicker, Konsole, Control Center, etc.).

In related news, we can safely say that, rumours to the contrary notwithstanding, NixOS is not an [April Foolsâ€™ Joke](http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=17601).

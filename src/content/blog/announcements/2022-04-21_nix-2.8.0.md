We're pleased to announce the availability of Nix 2.8.0. It will be available from [NixOS - Getting Nix / NixOS](https://nixos.org/download.html).

Here are the release notes:

*   New experimental command: `nix fmt`, which applies a formatter defined by the `formatter.<system>` flake output to the Nix expressions in a flake.
*   Various Nix commands can now read expressions from standard input using `--file -`.
*   New experimental builtin function `builtins.fetchClosure` that copies a closure from a binary cache at evaluation time and rewrites it to content-addressed form (if it isn’t already). Like `builtins.storePath`, this allows importing pre-built store paths; the difference is that it doesn’t require the user to configure binary caches and trusted public keys.
    
    This function is only available if you enable the experimental feature `fetch-closure`.
    
*   New experimental feature: _impure derivations_. These are derivations that can produce a different result every time they’re built. Here is an example:
    
    stdenv.mkDerivation {
      name = "impure";
      \_\_impure = true; # marks this derivation as impure
      buildCommand = "date > $out";
    }
    
    Running nix build twice on this expression will build the derivation twice, producing two different content-addressed store paths. Like fixed-output derivations, impure derivations have access to the network. Only fixed-output derivations and impure derivations can depend on an impure derivation.
    
*   `nix store make-content-addressable` has been renamed to nix store `make-content-addressed`.
*   The `nixosModule` flake output attribute has been renamed consistent with the `.default` renames in Nix 2.7.
    
    *   `nixosModule` → `nixosModules.default`
    
    As before, the old output will continue to work, but `nix flake check` will issue a warning about it.
    
*   `nix run` is now stricter in what it accepts: members of the `apps` flake output are now required to be apps (as defined in [the manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-run.html#apps)), and members of `packages` or `legacyPackages` must be derivations (not apps).

The [next release](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/milestone/17) is scheduled for 2022-05-30.

Thank you to all the contributors!

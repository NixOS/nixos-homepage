Hello everyone, we are [Tristan Ross](https://github.com/RossComputerguy) and [Weijia Wang](https://github.com/wegank), the release managers for the newest release of NixOS known as NixOS 24.11 Vicuña. We're glad to announce that after the additional week-long delay that we can deliver this stable release of NixOS.

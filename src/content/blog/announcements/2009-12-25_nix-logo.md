 [![Nix       logo](../../../assets/logo/nixos-lores.png)](../../../assets/logo/nixos-hires.png) Long overdue, the Nix project finally has a logo! The logo was originally created by [Simon Frankau](http://arbitrary.name/) for the [Haskell logo competition](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_logos/New_logo_ideas), who kindly gave us permission to use it for the Nix project. (The snowflake motif is even more appropriate for Nix, because _nix_ is Latin for _snow_.) Any further modifications are entirely our fault.

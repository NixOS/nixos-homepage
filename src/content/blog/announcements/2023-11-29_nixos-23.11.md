This release saw **9147 new** packages and **18700 updated** packages in Nixpkgs. We also **removed 4015** packages in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure.
In addition to packages the NixOS distribution also features modules and tests that make it what it is. This release brought **113 new** modules and **removed 18**. In that process we **added 1565** options and **removed 362**.

### GNOME 45

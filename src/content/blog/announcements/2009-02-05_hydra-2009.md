[Nix](https://hydra.nixos.org/releases/nix/unstable) and [NixOS](https://hydra.nixos.org/project/nixos/jobstatus) releases are now built in [Hydra](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra), the new Nix-based continuous build system. Hydra replaces our [old Nix-based build farm](https://web.archive.org/web/20090412101819/http://buildfarm.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/status), which will be phased out soon. There are several advantages over the old build farm: the build tasks for a project are scheduled and published separately, so that for instance a (fast) tarball build doesnâ€™t have to wait for a (slow) Cygwin build; build results are stored in a database, which will enable all sorts of interesting queries; better error reporting; a better web interface; and much more. We have written a [draft paper about Hydra](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/hydra-scp-submitted.pdf). There are some [instructions available](https://hydra.nixos.org/job/hydra/trunk/build/latest/download-by-type/doc/manual) about how to set up your own Hydra server.

### My Reflections and Closing

Being release manager for 20.03 has been a poignant moment for me in being part of NixOS. I had my goals that I set out before I was appointed, but I was really surprised how respected I am in the community. My primary goal was “work collaboratively with all participants in the NixOS project and being supportive of their efforts”. I feel I ✨ shine **best** in that dynamic in the project, so this really was perfect for me. I hope releasing NixOS has **felt** better for those involved. With the seeds I’ve planted it should continue to bloom this way.

I’d like to thank [Samuel Leathers](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/disassembler), my co-release manager, for his congruent effervescence and guidance; [Graham Christensen](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/grahamc) for his organizational encouragement; and obviously every last person I got to work with. Thanks ✌️

In leisure, pause, and experimental grace. [worldofpeace](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/worldofpeace).

We're pleased to announce the availability of [Nix 2.6.0](https://releases.nixos.org/?prefix=nix/nix-2.6.0/).

Instructions how to install Nix on different platforms can be found on [the download page](/download).

Here are the release notes:

*   New builtin function `builtins.zipAttrsWith` with the same functionality as `lib.zipAttrsWith` from Nixpkgs, but much more efficient.
*   The Nix CLI now searches for a `flake.nix` up until the root of the current Git repository or a filesystem boundary rather than just in the current directory.
*   The TOML parser used by `builtins.fromTOML` has been replaced by [a more compliant one](https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11).
*   Added `:st`/`:show-trace` commands to nix repl, which are used to set or toggle display of error traces.
*   New command `nix store copy-log` to copy build logs from one store to another.
*   The `commit-lockfile-summary` option can be set to a non-empty string to override the commit summary used when commiting an updated lockfile. This may be used in conjunction with the `nixConfig` attribute in `flake.nix` to better conform to repository conventions.
*   `docker run -ti nixos/nix:master` will place you in the Docker container with the latest version of Nix from the master branch.

The [next release](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/milestone/15) is scheduled for 2022-03-07.

Thank you to all the contributors!

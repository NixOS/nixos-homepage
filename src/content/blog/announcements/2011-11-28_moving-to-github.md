The NixOS project is (slowly) migrating from Subversion to Git! The master repositories will be hosted in the [NixOS organization](https://github.com/NixOS/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/). For the moment, just a few subprojects have been migrated, such as [Hydra](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra) and [Charon](https://github.com/NixOS/charon). Thanks to Tianyi Cui for donating the NixOS GitHub organization.

  \... when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes.
  (J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)
title: "#01 - Phoenixes burst into flame \\..."
---

The phoenix is a long-lived fiery bird that is present in many different
mythologies from around the world. When a phoenix "dies", it does so by
combustion and is reborn of the ashes left behind. It rises from its own
ashes, in the freshness of youth, to live through another cycle of
years. So in a sense, it never truly dies, but regenerates itself and
lives forever. Just like this weekly newsletter.

Welcome to the 2018 NixOS "Weekly" newsletter.

We are back and hope to produce more of them this year then we did last
year. As always contributions are more then welcome. The more people
help shape this newsletter the more accurate it will be.

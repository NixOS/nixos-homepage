# News

-   [The NixCon 2018 sold out and program is now
    live](https://nixcon2018.org/#program)

-   [Help make the Nix ecosystem\'s docs better](https://docbook.rocks)

    A lot of people meet DocBook for the first time when they\'re
    contributing to the documentation of older, well established open
    source projects like NixOS. Now there is <https://docbook.rocks/> to
    help you get past the initial hurdle of \"what do I do now?\" I hope
    this helps!

    images](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix/tags/)

    SDKs](http://sandervanderburg.blogspot.com/2018/09/creating-nix-build-function.html)

    nix](http://mpickering.github.io/posts/2018-09-19-nix-artefacts.html)

-   [A way to develop software with
    Nix](https://github.com/shajra/example-nix)

    This project illustrates using the Nix package manager for
    programming heterogeneous, multi-module projects. Notably, it
    provides a Nix library called Pkgs-make to save some of the
    boilerplate we might have to write when using Nix for managing a
    software lifecycle. Pkgs-make currently directly supports Haskell
    and Python development, but has the potential to support other
    language platforms.

    Nix before
    upgrading](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation)

Or in other words: no more Perl in Nix! Shea Levy\'s last branch for his
long-ongoing work to remove Perl from the Nix tool has [finally been
merged](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/1027)

# News

-   NixOS on [Packet.net](https://www.packet.net)

    Over the past several months, **Graham Christensen** (grahamc),
    **Tuomas Tynkkynen** (dezgeg), and many wonderful people from
    [Packet.net](https://www.packet.net) have collaborated on bringing
    NixOS to Packet.net.

    Our collaboratioon started in January with **Packet sponsoring many
    Hydra build servers**. It continued by bringing ARMv8 builders to
    hydra.nixos.org. It is continued again today by launching
    first-class support for NixOS on the Packet.net platform, directly
    from their panel.

    > \...launching first-class support for NixOS\...

    This allows any user to quickly provision four different types of
    powerful, bare metal x86-64 servers in minutes.

    This is a fun one because it is the first CVE taken against NixOS. A
    milestone!

    At this point we also must thank \@grahamc and the security team for

    solution.

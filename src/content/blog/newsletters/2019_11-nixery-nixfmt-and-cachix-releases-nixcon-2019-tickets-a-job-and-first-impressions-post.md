# News

- [nix is now easier to bootstrap](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/2979) on Linux distributions without previous nix installation.

  Non-NixOS users are encouraged to try and report whether the improved autoconf checks make it easier to build it from source.

- [`static-haskell-nix` started a crowd-funding](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/43795#issuecomment-503048915) on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/static-haskell-nix) during [ZuriHac](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2019/) to get its own dedicated Hetzner build server. Amazingly, the funding goal was reached [within only 4 days](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/43795#issuecomment-504266116)!

- A big rework of the `gstreamer` package landed in nixpkgs with the [upgrade to 1.16](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/54398).

  It also demonstrates how `meson`-build-system-based projects can be configured to complain loudly about any missing dependencies, as opposed to silently disabling features (like many `autoconf` based build systems do).

- [Cachix 0.2.1 released](https://github.com/cachix/cachix/blob/master/cachix/CHANGELOG.md#021---2019-07-05)

  Upgrade via the usual: `$ nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install`

  Notable improvement is the default compression level which has been lowered to increase
  bandwidth throughput and it's overridable via `--compression-level`.

- [Hercules CI #5 update requiredSystemFeatures, Cachix and Darwin
  support](https://blog.hercules-ci.com/sprints,/hercules-ci/2019/07/09/development-update-5-cachix-da
  rwin/)

  Preview access for the CI has been given to all subscribers as we've reached feature parity for the
  public launch.

- [Functional DevOps in a Dysfunctional World](https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2019/07/04/functional-devops/index.html)

- [Obsidian Systems is hiring a Nix engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/cf8ni3/job_offer_obsidian_systems_is_hiring_a_nix/)

- [nixfmt 0.2 release](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixfmt-beta-release/3545)

  Please try it out on your code and give us feedback!

    Some of you might have heard about NixOS and its very different
    approach to a package and configuration management. While I am
    certainly not an expert with Nix myself I did tinker with it for a
    bit and I think it\'s awesome. I would like to give you an idea of
    the concepts, possibilities and maybe spark some interest.

-   **Feb 24--26, 2017**,
    [HackIllinois](https://medium.com/@HackIllinois/open-source-2017-b322ad688471#.vim3uki6h),

    For any university students in the US, the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign is holding a hackathon oriented towards getting
    people into open source development, and I\'m going to be mentoring
    people for Nix/NixOS/Haskell development. Be sure to put \"NixOS\"
    or \"Haskell\" into your application somewhere.

# Jobs

-   [Smarkets](https://smarkets.com/about), London, United Kingdom

    We are looking for [Infra team
    lead](https://boards.greenhouse.io/smarkets/jobs/486940) and [Infra
    engineer](https://boards.greenhouse.io/smarkets/jobs/486940).

    The jobs are not a Nix jobs per se since we are not using Nix at the
    moment. However, internally few of us are interested in trying it
    for e.g. building AMIs or provisioning docker containers with
    (mostly) python software. We think some strong candidate with
    experience of using Nix in production would have a good chance of
    seeing some adoption here.

[Write us](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-weekly/issues/new) if you are
looking for some Nix developers.

# Editor\'s corner

Lately, I was thinking about the structure of this newsletter and
noticed that it is quite **advance Nix** oriented. Would a section where
we would **promote** questions from reddit / stack overflow be of any
help to newcomers? [Let me know.](https://twitter.com/garbas)

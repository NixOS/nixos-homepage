### Multi-user installation (recommended)

Install Nix via the <span class="font-bold">recommended</span> [multi-user installation](/manual/nix/stable/installation/multi-user):

```bash
$ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

We recommend the multi-user install if you are on Linux running systemd, with SELinux disabled and you can authenticate with `sudo`.

### Single-user installation

Install Nix via the [single-user installation](/manual/nix/stable/installation/single-user):

```bash
$ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
```

Above command will perform a single-user installation of Nix, meaning that `nix` is owned by the invoking user. You should run this under your usual user account, not as `root`. The script will invoke `sudo` to create `/nix` if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

### Which type of installation should you choose?

This depends on your requirements, but here is a short list of reasons why <span class="font-bold">we recommend</span> [multi-user installation](/manual/nix/stable/installation/multi-user):

#### Pros

- Better build isolation (and that is what Nix is all about)
- Better security (a build can not write somewhere in your home)
- Sharing builds between users

#### Cons

- Requires `root` to run the daemon
- More involved installation (creation of `nixbld* users`, installing a systemd unit, ...
- Harder to uninstall

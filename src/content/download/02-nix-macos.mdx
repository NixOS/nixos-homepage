Install Nix via the **recommended** [multi-user installation](/manual/nix/stable/installation/multi-user):

```bash
$ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

We believe we have ironed out how to cleanly support the read-only root on modern macOS. Please [consult the manual](/manual/nix/stable/installation/installing-binary#macos-installation) on details what the installation script does.

The Geospatial Team is responsible for everything related to geospatial software in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

We're keeping geospatial packages and modules up to date and we package new software regularly.

If you like [what we do](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/projects/47), please let us know.

If you want to join the Geospatial Team, add yourself to the `geospatial` team in the [Nixpkgs team list](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/team-list.nix).
Create pull request with short introduction of yourself and assign it to one of the other members.

  NixNG is a proof-of-concept distribution which works very similarly to NixOS, but aims to run well

  open to multi-init support and also to our own init system.

  With the Nix process management framework you can write high-level deployment specifications of
  running processes, that can be managed with a variety of process managers (e.g. systemd,
  supervisord, launchd, s6-rc). Furthermore, you can construct multiple instances of the same
  processes and deploy them as an unprivileged user. The testing framework allows you to validate a
  service under all these conditions.

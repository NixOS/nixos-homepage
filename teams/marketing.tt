<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Main tool (and responsibility) is https://nixos.org 2 and the content on
    it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Research market / ecosystems where Nix/NixOS compete. How Nix/NixOS fits
    in it and where it stands out.
  </li>
  <li>
    Listen to the community, connect with companies that offer Nix/NixOS
    consulting how nixos.org could better help them promote their services.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to participate and help?</h2>

<p>
  Clearly the topics that the marketing team will discuss are very
  bikesheddey. We would like to see the team being assembled from every corner
  of a Nix community. To join the team please write an email to 
  <a href="mailto:webmaster@nixos.org">webmaster@nixos.org</a> trying to
  answer the following questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why would you like to join the team?</li>
  <li>Why are you interested in marketing Nix?</li>
  <li>What drives you?</li>
  <li>How would you contribute to the marketing team?</li>
  <li>What is your idea what marketing team will work on, this year? Next year?
      Next 5 years?</li>
  <li>What could be few easy fixes to the website that would solve problems
      that you heard others complain about Nix/NixOS?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The answers are actually not used to judge people if they are good enough to
  join, but to understand the person joining, their intent and their vision.
  Since we will discuss many things that could be very bikeshedding it is
  important that we understand each other’s position and the context they are
  arguing from.
</p>

<h2>Meetings</h2>

<p>
  You can expect at meetings to discuss things first in an abstract manner
  (what are our goals) and only then get into more concrete proposals (how do
  we achieve goals). Meetings will be scheduled as needed and as much as the
  team has time, but at least once a month. Initially it might happen that we
  will meet more often until the whole idea of what a marketing team is/does
  is bootstrapped. Minutes of the meetings will be published with the potential
  agenda and the date of the next meeting.
</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>I tried to anticipate some questions/reactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        What’s with all the corporate lingo? We are an open source community
        and not a company?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the language I’m familiar with and I know few others are as well.
      If there are things that bother you please contact any of us and propose
      ways in which we can improve.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why not use the RFC process?</strong></p>
    <p>
      The RFC process targets changes to the Nix ecosystem. Technical changes,
      not social changes. Going through the RFC process would expose this
      endeavor to unneeded bikeshedding.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        How will you avoid bikeshedding? How will you get anything done?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>We will try to do our best. Patience is the key :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How will you handle controversial topics?</strong></p>
    <p>
      When a controversial topic comes to be discussed we will look at it from
      all the sides and provide a summary. We will try to invite the
      community (especially the concerned part of the community) to get
      involved more and try to clarify in as much as clear way as possible.
      Experience shows that most of the time problem is in communication and
      this is what we will always try to do better.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I don’t like that the community is becoming professional, can we just hack?</strong></p>
    <p>We always avoid success, but let’s try for once to plan it :)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
